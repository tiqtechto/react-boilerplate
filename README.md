## Webpack Setup

The boilerplate uses **Webpack** for bundling and development. The Webpack configuration is optimized for React development, ensuring fast reloads and efficient builds. 

You can customize the Webpack configuration as per your needs by editing the `webpack.config.dev.js` file located in the project root. This file contains settings for module bundling, file processing, and development server options.

To modify Webpack settings for production or development:

1. Open the `webpack.config.dev.js` file for development configurations.
2. Adjust the options such as entry points, output directories, loaders (e.g., Babel for JavaScript and CSS loaders), and plugins.
3. Restart the development server to apply the new configurations.
